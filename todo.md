# Deploying and Setting Up CI/CD for Full-Stack Application on OpenShift

## 1. Prepare OpenShift Environment
- [x] Ensure necessary permissions on OpenShift cluster
- [x] Set up project/namespace for the application

## 2. Containerize Applications (if not already done)
- [x] Create Dockerfile for backend
- [x] Create Dockerfile for frontend
- [x] Build and test containers locally

## 3. Push Containers to Registry
- [x] Set up access to a container registry (e.g., OpenShift's internal registry or Docker Hub)
- [x] Push backend container to registry
- [x] Push frontend container to registry

## 4. Create OpenShift Deployment Configurations
- [x] Create YAML file for backend deployment
- [x] Create YAML file for frontend deployment
- [x] Define Services and Routes in YAML files

## 5. Manual Deployment to OpenShift
- [ ] Apply backend deployment configuration: `oc apply -f backend-deployment.yaml`
- [ ] Apply frontend deployment configuration: `oc apply -f frontend-deployment.yaml`
- [ ] Verify deployments: `oc get pods`, `oc get services`, `oc get routes`
- [ ] Test functionality of deployed applications

## 6. Set Up Tekton (CI)
- [ ] Install Tekton Pipelines on OpenShift cluster
- [ ] Install Tekton Triggers on OpenShift cluster
- [ ] Create Tekton Tasks YAML files:
  - [ ] Git clone task
  - [ ] Backend build and test task
  - [ ] Frontend build and test task
  - [ ] Image build and push task
- [ ] Create Tekton Pipeline YAML file combining all tasks
- [ ] Create Tekton Trigger YAML file for automating pipeline execution
- [ ] Apply all Tekton configurations to OpenShift

## 7. Set Up Argo CD (CD)
- [ ] Install Argo CD on OpenShift cluster
- [ ] Create Argo CD Application YAML pointing to deployment configurations in git repository
- [ ] Apply Argo CD configurations to OpenShift

## 8. Update Git Repository
- [ ] Add all Tekton YAML files to git repository
- [ ] Add Argo CD YAML files to git repository
- [ ] Commit and push changes

## 9. Test CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Make a small change to the application (frontend or backend)
- [ ] Commit and push change to git repository
- [ ] Observe Tekton pipeline execution
- [ ] Verify Argo CD detects changes and syncs to cluster
- [ ] Confirm changes are reflected in the deployed application

## 10. Develop and Deploy New Functionality
- [ ] Develop new feature locally (both frontend and backend changes)
- [ ] Commit and push changes to git repository
- [ ] Monitor CI/CD pipeline execution
- [ ] Verify new functionality in the deployed application

## 11. Final Checks and Optimizations
- [ ] Ensure proper versioning of container images
- [ ] Update deployment configurations to use specific image versions
- [ ] Test rollback procedures
- [ ] Document the CI/CD process for team reference
